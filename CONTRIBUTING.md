# Contributing to Fabric
Everyone is welcome to contribute to Fabric and `fabric`-deployed [#products][product-chat].  While we cannot make any guarantees of success, safety, or even stability, we are happy to work together with _anyone_ seeking the same.  **To maintain a civil working environment**, we ask that all members of our community follow one simple rule:

> Don't be an asshole.

## Intellect
Contributing your intellectual capital is the best way to support Fabric.  [Get involved in Grove][chat-grove], our community chat, and we'll help you get started.

## Code
Code contributions can be made through [`git@github.com:FabricLabs/fabric.git`][source-fabric].  We keep track of issues in [`#beta:fabric.pub`][chat-beta], where you can get an `!invite` when made available by application developers.

Progress can be tracked in [`#meta:fabric.pub`][chat-meta].

## Bitcoin
Do not send Bitcoin to any of our previously published addresses.  We'll enable Lightning donations soon, which have far superior privacy.

**Remember:** don't reuse Bitcoin addresses!

## Artwork
We're borne of a swarm of storytellers, eager to tell a tale.  [Join `#lobby:roleplaygateway.com`][chat-rpg-lobby] to start your journey, or [jump to the end][rpg] to list your work.
