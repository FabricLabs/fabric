Fabric is an experimental approach to the secure establishment and execution of
peer-to-peer agreements, up to and including financial transactions.  With a
robust library of common components, `npm i @fabric/core` provides all the tools
one might `require` during the development of a well-researched application of
decentralization technology.

| ðŸš¨ Heads up! |
|--------------|
| Use of Fabric in production is **not recommended** in its current state.  Please wait for [an official release][releases] before deploying to production environments, or proceed at your own risk. |

## Getting Started
If you're already familiar with `node` and have a project already started, try
`npm install --save @fabric/core` to install [Fabric Core](https://fabric.pub),
the primary library used for most Fabric-based applications.

Fork and clone [the Fabric GitHub repository][fabric-github] and launch a local
web server with `npm run examples` to view the examples, or `npm run docs` once
you're ready to integrate Fabric into your application.

## Available Commands
- `npm run cli` provides a direct command-line interface to the Fabric network.
- `npm run dev` serves a developer interface over localhost HTTP.
- `npm run docs` creates a local HTTP server for browsing documentation.
- `npm run examples` creates a local HTTP server for interacting with examples.
- `npm start` creates a local Fabric node.

## API
The Fabric reference implementation exposes a simple message-passing interface
using [the actor model][actor-model], enabling your downstream applications to
subscribe to simple events for rapid prototyping of distributed applications.

### Using as a Library
Using the `EventEmitter` pattern, you can create an instance of Fabric to use
it as an event source.

#### Simple Example
```js
const Fabric = require('@fabric/core');
const fabric = new Fabric();

fabric.on('message', function (message) {
  console.log('Received message from Fabric:', message);
});

fabric.start();
```

`service` now contains a full instance of Fabric, including `SET` and `GET`
methods for publishing and retrieving documents.  Use `npm run examples` to see
more.

### Message Types
Message types are as follows:

#### `message`
The generic message event.

**Properties:**
- `@type` name of the event type.
- `@data` the content of the event, if any.

### Using Fabric in the Browser
Fabric generates a `fabric.min.js` bundle, which can be included with any HTML
document to expose the API in a browser.

## Other Fabrics
Several other projects have used the name Fabric, as it's a great way to
describe a network of things, conjuring feelings of _nets_ and _webs_.  Here are
some links to them, as they offer some interesting things completely unrelated
to our goals.

- Fabric python project (#fabric on Freenode)
- Fabric application framework by Twitter
- HyperLedger Fabric, by IBM


## Plugins
Fabric is an extensible framework, supporting a variety of plugins.

| Package                            | Description                                | Status                                                                                                                                       |

## Running on Fabric
Several successful projects are built with or are running on Fabric, including:

- [soundtrack.io][soundtrack.io], Internet jukebox
- [Doorman][doorman], an artificially intelligent assistant
- [IdleRPG][idlerpg], a simple RPG game which rewards you for remaining idle
- [Verse][verse], a virtual universe simulator

To add your project to the list, [read the API docs][api-docs], create a public
repository for the source code, then [edit this file][edit-readme] to include a
link to your work.
