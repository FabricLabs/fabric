# Fabric Engineering Goals

1. Complexity is the enemy.  Prefer simplicity.
2. Make it work, make it right, make it fast.  In that order.
3. Improve access to human liberty with every contribution.

## Alternatives
1. Secure Sovereignty
2. Equivalent (or superior) Experience
3. Eliminate Trusted Third Parties

## Mindset
Precision engineering requires long periods of intense focus.  We seek healthy work/life balances,
especially surrounding R&D related activities (Fabric Labs).  Striving for excellence is paramount,
and no mission succeeds without a clearly-defined set of goals.

## Current Goals
These are our immediate (2021) goals:

- [ ] Find all TODO items (run script, check diff)
- [ ] Audit all documentation
- [ ] Check all hyperlinks on `npm run dev`
- [ ] 100% test coverage
- [ ] Completion of 1 or more of our #projects: https://chat.fabric.pub/#/room/#projects:fabric.pub
