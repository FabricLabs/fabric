# Fabric Contracts
Contracts in Fabric are simple agreements between two or more peers.

## Contract Elements
Fabric Contracts consist of several key components.

- Initial Contract State
- Contract Messages
- Contract Script (Taproot Program)

## Using `@fabric/core/types/contract`
The `Contract` type can be imported from `@fabric/core` using the following JavaScript:
```js
const Contract = require('@fabric/core/types/contract`);
```

To deploy the contract, fund the deposit address generated by:
```js
const Contract = require('@fabric/core/types/contract`);
const contract = new Contract();

contract.deploy();
```
